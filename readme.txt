== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= I cannot see the options for "PBP Restricted Menu-Widget by role" under menu items in the Admin Panel? =

This usually occurs due to a plugin conflict.  The Admin Menu Walker can only have one custom walker so any other plugin that uses a custom Admin Menu Walker will cause conflicts with "PBP Restricted Menu-Widget by role".

Wordpress does not yet have sufficient hooks in this area of the admin panel.  Due to this plugins are forced to load a modifed custom Admin Menu Walker.  The custom Admin Menu Walker is limited to one so only one Admin Panel menu modification plugin can be active at one time.
